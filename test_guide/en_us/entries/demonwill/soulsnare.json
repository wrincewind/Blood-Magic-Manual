Kill them quickly and you should get a $(l:demonwill/demonwill)$(item)Demon Will$(). Before you ask, yes, the Looting enchantment will improve your odds. Once you've gathered a couple, you can get to work on crafting yourself a $(l:demonwill/sentientsword)$(item)Sentient Sword$() and a $(l:demonwill/soulgem)$(item)Tartaric Gem$() - these will make collecting $(l:demonwill/demonwill)$(item)Demon Will$() much easier."
