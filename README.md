# Blood-Magic-Manual
early beta - a version of the Blood Magic manual using Patchouli.

This version of the guide requires code additions to Blood Magic.  For development, we are using a custom jar file not distributed here.  Sorry, you'll have to wait until the mod updates before this version of the guide is fully public.
