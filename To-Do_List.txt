check every item with the guide to see if it has an entry (even if it's 'nyi')

test_guide/en_us/entries/utility/bloodstone_bricks.json
	link to Weak Blood Shards in the ARC - check this.

test_guide/en_us/entries/altar/soul_network.json 
	5k/25k/150k/1M or 5,000 / 25,000, 150,000, 1,000,000 ? 

test_guide/en_us/entries/utility/alchemical_reaction_chamber.json
Sulfer > Sulfur (fixed this in the description, but the recipe is also 
spelled wrong. Is this typo in the book or the mod?)

Way - why 5mb of lava? Given how easy the lava ritual is, this seems more like
'something you have to figure out how to dump' than 'a useful source of lava'.

test_guide/en_us/entries/utility/bloodstone_bricks.json
mention the Weak Blood Shards used for them, and link to the relevant ARC Page?
	look into anchors (and use them all over the place)

general second passthrough for consistency, ensuring all pages are linked whenever they're mentioned, adding additional recipes and items to the pages to enable patchoulli's 'hold ctrl to view entry' functon to work, etc.



NOT YET IMPLEMENTED (circle back later)

Custom recipe handlers for the Altar, Arcane Ash, and the Hellfire Forge. (Ask Way very very nicely?)

ON PATCHOULI'S END 
oredict tags for e.g. colours of glass, types of stone, levels of sentient gem. Currently waiting for https://github.com/Vazkii/Patchouli/pull/335 to be approved.
[n.b. most of these will be made redundant by custom recipe handlers, above]
