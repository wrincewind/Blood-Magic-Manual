general:
    Most of the pages I added content to will need a formatting pass for things
    like the text color highlights and possibly some links.

demon_will/demon_will:
    "In the lore of Blood Magic...inbues its will into the bodies of the dead."
    What about living mobs, like Endermen and Creepers? Way gets authority, but
    my interpretation was that it's the imbued will of a demon that causes mobs
    to be hostile to a player.  "Neutral" mobs are those that are able to
    resist the effects, but not completely.

demon_will/soul_gem (and others):
    Thanks to Data Packs and modpacks frequently changing recipes, we may want
    to avoid mentioning the default ingredients in the text descriptions.  I
    mean, I did put in the extra effort to make sure this guide will show any
    altered recipes.

altar/blood_altar:
    Please mention that the first 1,000 LP you sacrifice will go to an internal
    "extract" tank.  That has caused a lot of confusion in the past.  "Why is
    my Blood Altar draining?!"
    
    The Altar Pillars do not have to be "solid" blocks.  I think they can be
    basically anything.  The code says "not air."

altar/redstone_automation:
    I think this all is NYI.

altar/slates:
    I think almost all of the text on this page can get nuked.  If that does
    happen, please make sure you update the "extra_recipe_mappings" at the top
    of that entry.  The number is which page it should go to when someone tries
    to find the recipe of that slate, and it starts counting from 0.

I only had time to get through the Demon Will and Blood Altars chapters.  I do
remember wanting to note something else though...

utility/getting_started:
    Sentient Sword should be Tier-0.  You do not need a Blood Altar to use it.
